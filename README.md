# 🧠 mudlogger-notes

A living, modular knowledge base of cheat sheets, syntax references, and practical coding patterns created during my transition into data science, software scripting, and technical operations.  

Whether I'm writing Python, suffering through Excel/VBA, or working with Git/GitHub in JupyterLab, this repo keeps me grounded.

## 🗂️ Current Topics

- `need_to_know_python.md` → Full Python scripting cheat sheet
- `excel_vba_cheat_sheet.md` → Upcoming guide for surviving the spreadsheet dimension
- More `.md` files to come: GitHub, JupyterLab, plotting, data cleaning, and more

## 🧪 Why?

Because I’m learning fast, writing better code, and turning knowledge into reusable tools instead of just drowning in tutorials. Also, typing things out helps me not forget them.

## 📌 Work in Progress

I update this repo as I:
- Finish lessons and projects
- Learn from mistakes
- Automate repetitive field tasks
- Clean data for analysis or dashboarding
